# banking-app

This CLI application simulates a simple banking management terminal.
Note that this app is designed to be used for managing the services of an imaginary bank (let's call it *PAO Bank*) and not to be used by a customer of a bank, therefore not having a login functionality.

## Project Timeline
### 1st Phase

#### Requirements
System with
- at least 10 actions/ queries that can be made;
- at least 8 types of objects.

To implement:
- classes having private/ protected data members & access methods.
- at least 2 distinct collections for managing the objects defined previously (e.g. List, Set, Map, etc.) - and at least 1 sorted (implement Comparable).
- use inheritance.
- at least 1 service class exposing the actions.
- 1 Main class - making calls to the services.

## Structure
- package accounts
    - abstract class Account
        - class CheckingAccount
        - class SavingsAccount
    - class AccountFactory
- package card
    - class Card
- package atm
    - class Atm
    - abstract class AtmTransaction
        - class Deposit
        - class Withdrawal
- package transfer
    - class Transfer
- package Utils
    - class Address
    - class RandomGenerator
- package services
    - class ClientService
    - class AccountService
    - class TransactionService
    - class AtmService
    - class BankingInteractor
- class Main (uses class BankingService)

Notes:
The withdrawal function should only work if the bank account has enough money to withdraw a requested amount.

## Actions

Thoughts
- Builder pattern?
- use interfaces for services
- Add currency class?

Later on:
- JUnit testing - mocking / test doubles
- add GUI?
- use UUID?
- Logging class?
- Better handle exceptions?

Notes
- time has been preferred to Date [useful article](https://stackabuse.com/how-to-get-current-date-and-time-in-java/)
- I chose to not implement a class with constants or declare my constants as static final, but instead, I used enums.
  [useful article](https://tedvinke.wordpress.com/2016/04/14/2-rookie-java-constants-and-enums-pitfalls/)
- Used BigDecimal s for balance instead of double - because floating point values are not precise.
